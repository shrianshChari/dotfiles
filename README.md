### To-do:
- Configure installation of packages that come from websites

### Completed: ###
- Scripts that install packages from apt - Installation of Atom packages
- Created symlinks for `bashrc`, `gitconfig`, and either `bash_profile` or `profile`
- For scripts that use apt, make sure that you can use other package managers (`rpm`, `pacman`, etc.)
- Made updating packages optional (though I'm not very familiar with updating package list on non-Ubuntu distros)
