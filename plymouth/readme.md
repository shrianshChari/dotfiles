# Plymouth Config
If you don't know what this is, this is a modified boot screen for my laptop running Pop_OS. Essentially, you add the watermark (which is the Pop_OS logo), the plymouth file, then `sudo update-initramfs -u`, and the next time you reboot, you'll get a progress bar and Pop_OS logo.

Used [this guide](https://github.com/spxak1/weywot/blob/main/guides/lazybootscreen.md) to set it up, backup is included to ensure I can always get back to original state.
